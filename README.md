**WARNING:** This project was created for personal usage and learning purpose, use [other tools](#other-tools) instead, which were written by better developers than me. ðŸ˜‚

Sometimes, I think that using the existing tools for managing programming languages, projects structures, containers, VMs and others things like that are more complicated than a 10x10x10 Rubik Cube, just kidding ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚ but really, sometimes:

* I want to use the latest version of my favorite programming language, but the packages manager doesn't help and I shouldn't install it by myself. ðŸ˜¡

* I want to understand at least the 15% of my application source code, but the scaffolding tool from the framework is a better developer than me and I should do what it say, remember, don't reinvent the wheel. ðŸ˜¡

* I try to create my own controlled and isolated environment, but I should do all what the [OCI](https://www.opencontainers.org/)) says, use super complex softwares like [cluster managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cluster_management_software) and [virtual machines managers](https://libvirt.org/apps.html), no matter if I have no idea what happens behind scenes, again, I should not reinvent the wheel. ðŸ˜¡

I am not trying to say that all this things are bad, actually it is great to know that out there are so many smart people who already solved the problems that I am facing, and even better, they shared the solution; but it doesn't mean that I shouldn't known how they did it. At work or production environments, it is good, saving time and using well tested software is a must do, but if I just want to learn some fundamentals for being a better developer, I think that it is a must don't.

P.S. I know that I can't say all this things using high level tools, but in a near future (hopefully), I will try to go at the lowest level that I can.
